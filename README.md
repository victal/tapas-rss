# tapas-rss

A Webextension (currently working on Firefox) that adds RSS buttons on [tapas.io](https://tapas.io) series pages.

Tapas is a platform for publishing and reading webcomics and webnovels and, while it still provides RSS feeds for the series it hosts, there is no ui component to access these feeds. This webextension restores such functionality.


Do you enjoy reading webcomics? Do you like using RSS instead of each different site's App/subscribe method? Then this extension is for you.
